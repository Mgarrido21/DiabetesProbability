# DiabetesProbability

This programm consists of 2 parts; first it creates a Decision Tree that evaluates given Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, BMI, and Age in order to tell you if you should keep eating Pan de Muerto, or maybe visit the doctor.

The second part generates clusters using the method of Kmeans because the data presents a regular distribution.

The Data Set used was obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set?resource=download and the code is written in Python using Google Colab.
